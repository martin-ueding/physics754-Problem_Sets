While doing the exercises, I had a couple conceptional questions. They are
included in small italic font within the text. I would greatly appreciate it if
you could add a few remarks to each.

\section{A coordinate transformation}

\subsection{}

First of all, I will start by computing the components of the tensor $\pd{{x^\alpha}}{{y^\mu}}$:
\[
    \dpd{{x^\alpha}}{{y^\mu}}
    =
    \begin{pmatrix}
        1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
        0 & \sin(\theta) \cos(\phi) & \sin(\theta) \sin(\phi) & \cos(\theta) \\
        0 & r \cos(\theta) \cos(\phi) & r \cos(\theta) \sin(\phi) & - r \sin(\theta) \\
        0 & - r \sin(\theta) \sin(\phi) & r \sin(\theta) \cos(\phi) & 0
    \end{pmatrix}.
\]

With that, I can go through the components of $g$ and calculate each component.
I know that $g$ is symmetric, so I have only ten components to calculate. After
working with some trigonometric identities, I finally got this:
\[
    \tens g(\vec x)
    \sim
    \begin{pmatrix}
        1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
        0 & -1 & 0 & 0 \\
        0 & 0 & -r^2 & 0 \\
        0 & 0 & 0 & -r^2 \sin(\theta)^2
    \end{pmatrix}.
\]

\begin{aside}
    I wrote “$\tens g \sim$” since $\tens g$ is a tensor of valence (0, 2) and
    not a matrix with valence (1, 1). Would is be better to write “$g_{\mu\nu}
    =$” instead, although the left side would have two dangling indices,
    whereas the right side would not? Should one write it as “$g_{\mu\nu} =
    (\cdots)^\mu_\nu$” instead?
\end{aside}

\subsection{}

The electric field is given as
\[
    E_i(\vec x) = \frac{Q}{|x|^3} x_i.
\]

In the field tensor $\tens F$, the electric field is contained such that
$F_{0i} = E_i$. Therefore, I write
\[
    F_{0i}(\vec x) = \frac{Q}{|x|^3} x_i.
\]

From the antisymmetry, the other nonzero entries are $F_{i0}$.

\subsection{}

Now $\tens F$ will be transformed:
\begin{align*}
    \hat F_{\mu\nu}(\vec y)
    &= F_{\alpha\beta}(\vec y) \dpd{{x^\alpha}}{{y^\mu}} \dpd{{x^\beta}}{{y^\nu}}.
    \intertext{%
        Since most components of $\tens F$ are zero, I can restrict $\alpha$
        and $\beta$ such that only nonzero components remain:
    }
    &= F_{0i}(\vec y) \dpd{{x^0}}{{y^\mu}} \dpd{{x^i}}{{y^\nu}}.
    \intertext{%
        For the first partial derivative, the only nonzero part is the one for
        $\mu = 0$, which is just 1. This simplifies to:
    }
    \hat F_{0\nu}(\vec y)
    &= F_{0i}(\vec y) \dpd{{x^i}}{{y^\nu}}
    \intertext{%
        where the other nonzero components of $\hat{\tens F}$ are computed
        using the antisymmetry. Now I have summed over $i$ which gives (after
        trigonometry):
    }
    &= \frac{Q}{r^2} \begin{pmatrix}
        0 \\ 1 \\ 0 \\ 0
    \end{pmatrix}_\nu.
\end{align*}

From that, I conclude the following representation for the transformed field tensor:
\[
    \hat{\tens F}(\vec y)
    \sim
    \frac{Q}{r^2}
    \begin{pmatrix}
        0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\
        -1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
        0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
        0 & 0 & 0 & 0
    \end{pmatrix}
\]

\section{Calculating with Christoffel-Symbols}

I was trying to get a feeling for those Christoffel-Symbols by drawing them as
tensor diagrams. The metric is just a hoop:
\begin{center}
    \includegraphics{Drawing-0001.pdf}
\end{center}

Then the definition of the Christoffel-Symbol of the second kind can be drawn
as:
\begin{center}
    \includegraphics{Drawing-0002.pdf}
\end{center}

That definition with the great amount of indices can be visualized to some
extend in this notation. The first thing is just the partial derivative of
$\omega$, the next two stand for the terms with a plus, the last two for the
terms with the minus:
\begin{center}
    \includegraphics{Drawing-0003.pdf}
\end{center}

At this point, I do not see how they help with calculations, they just make
reading the indices a little easier.

\subsection{}

\begin{aside}
    I have the hunch that $\nabla \tens g = 0$ means that the metric is
    constant along geodesics. Does something like that hold?
\end{aside}

\newcommand\csk[3]{\Gamma^{#1}_{{#2}{#3}}}

\begin{align*}
    \nabla_\mu g_{\alpha\beta}
    &= \partial_\mu g_{\alpha\beta} - g_{\lambda\beta} \csk\gamma\alpha\mu
    - g_{\alpha\lambda} \csk\lambda\beta\mu \\
    \intertext{%
        Now I will just insert the definition of the Christoffel-Symbols for
        both occurrences.
    }
    &= \partial_\mu g_{\alpha\beta}
    - \frac12 g_{\lambda\beta} g^{\lambda\delta} \cdot (\partial_\alpha
    g_{\delta\mu} + \partial_\mu g_{\delta\alpha} - \partial_\delta
    g_{\mu\alpha})
    - \frac12 g_{\alpha\lambda} g^{\lambda\delta} \cdot (\partial_\beta g_{\delta\mu} +
    \partial_\mu g_{\delta\beta} - \partial_\delta g_{\mu\beta}) \\
    \intertext{%
        I have used a “$\cdot$” here to distinguish the opening parentheses
        from a function evaluation. No inner product is intended. As a next
        step, I contract the two $\tens g$ in the last two terms to yield a
        $\tens \delta$-symbol.
    }
    &= \partial_\mu g_{\alpha\beta}
    - \frac12 \delta\beta^\delta \cdot (\partial_\alpha g_{\delta\mu} + \partial_\mu g_{\delta\alpha} - \partial_\delta g_{\mu\alpha})
    - \frac12 \delta_\alpha^\delta \cdot (\partial_\beta g_{\delta\mu} + \partial_\mu g_{\delta\beta} - \partial_\delta g_{\mu\beta}) \\
    \intertext{%
        Contracting the $\tens \delta$:

    &= \partial_\mu g_{\alpha\beta}
    - \frac12 (\partial_\alpha g_{\beta\mu} + \partial_\mu g_{\beta\alpha} - \partial_\beta g_{\mu\alpha})
    - \frac12 (\partial_\beta g_{\alpha\mu} + \partial_\mu g_{\alpha\beta} - \partial_\alpha g_{\mu\beta}) \\
    \intertext{%
        Using the symmetry of $\tens g$, the first and last terms of other
        parentheses, respectively, cancel each other out. This leaves:
    }
    &= \partial_\mu g_{\alpha\beta}
    - \frac12 \partial_\mu g_{\beta\alpha}
    - \frac12 \partial_\mu g_{\alpha\beta} \\
    &= 0
\end{align*}

\subsection{Levi-Cività theorem}

\begin{aside}
    It has bothered me that $\partial_x$ is supposed to be a basis vector. It
    seems like an operator, and geometry is not quantum mechanics.

    But $\partial_i x^i = \delta^j_i$, so the $\partial_i$ are orthogonal to
    all other $x^j$. That makes it a normal vector to the plane spanned by the
    $\{ x^j \colon i \neq j \}$, right? Is that the reason why $\partial_x$ is
    considered a covector?
\end{aside}

\newcommand\equ[3]{\partial_{#1} g_{{#2}{#3}} = g_{\lambda{#3}} \Gamma^\lambda_{{#2}{#1}} + g_{{#2}\lambda} \Gamma^\lambda_{{#3}{#1}}}

Given is the following:
\[
    \equ\mu\alpha\beta
\]

The hint given on XXX is to permutate the indices. With that, I get six
equations:
\begin{gather*}
    \equ\mu\alpha\beta \\
    \equ\alpha\beta\mu \\
    \equ\beta\mu\alpha \\
    \equ\beta\alpha\mu \\
    \equ\alpha\mu\beta \\
    \equ\mu\beta\alpha.
\end{gather*}

The next step is to use the property that both $\tens g$ is symmetric in its
two lower indices. The $+$ also commutes. Therefore, the first and the last
equation are equivalent. Same holds for second and fifth, as well as third and
fourth. I choose to use the first three equations from now.

To isolate the $\tens \Gamma$-symbols, I use the symmetry of the lower indices
of $\tens \Gamma$, which is equivalent to the exterior derivative having zero
torsion. There are only three distinct Christoffel-symbols of the second kind
in those equations. To simplify the next steps, I will introduce aliases:
\[
    A_1 := \partial_\mu g_{\alpha\beta}
    \eqnsep
    A_2 := \partial_\alpha g_{\beta\mu}
    \eqnsep
    A_3 := \partial_\beta g_{\mu\alpha}
    \eqnsep
    B_1 := g_{\lambda\beta} \csk\beta\alpha\mu
    \eqnsep
    B_2 := g_{\lambda\mu} \csk\mu\beta\alpha
    \eqnsep
    B_3 := g_{\lambda\alpha} \csk\alpha\mu\beta.
\]

The system of the three equations now becomes the easier to read
\begin{align*}
    B_1 \phantom{+B_2} + B_3 &= A_1 \\
    B_1 + B_2 \phantom{+ B_3} &= A_2 \\
    \phantom{B_1 +} B_2 + B_3 &= A_3.
\end{align*}

I will omit the solving of with Gaussian elimination here and just state the
solution for $B_3$ that I obtained:
\[
    B_3 = \frac12 (A_1 - A_2 + A_3).
\]

By expanding the aliases again,
\[
    g_{\lambda\alpha} \csk\alpha\mu\beta = \frac12 (\partial_\mu g_{\alpha\beta} - \partial_\alpha g_{\beta\mu} + \partial_\beta g_{\mu\alpha})
\]
it can be seen that it is getting close to the desired result. The last step is
to add a $g^{\eta\alpha}$ to both sides. That will give me—apart from other
indices—the definition of the Christoffel-symbols of the second kind:
\begin{align*}
    g^{\eta\alpha} g_{\lambda\alpha} \csk\alpha\mu\beta &= \frac12
    g^{\eta\alpha} (\partial_\mu g_{\alpha\beta} - \partial_\alpha g_{\beta\mu}
    + \partial_\beta g_{\mu\alpha}) \\ 
    \csk\eta\mu\beta &= \frac12
    g^{\eta\alpha} (\partial_\mu g_{\alpha\beta} - \partial_\alpha g_{\beta\mu}
    + \partial_\beta g_{\mu\alpha}).
\end{align*}

If you substitute $\eta\mapsto\gamma$, $\mu\mapsto\beta$, $\beta\mapsto\alpha$
and $\alpha\mapsto\phi$, you will get the version on the problem set.
